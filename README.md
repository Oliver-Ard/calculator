# Calculator

Basic calculator with Vanilla JS.

<u>Features</u>:

- basic math operations(`addition`, `subtraction`, `multiplication` and `division`);
- type decimals numbers with `.` button;
- clear the input with `AC` button;
- delete the digits if you make a mistake with `DEL` button;
- easy divide the numbers to 100 with `%` button;
- negate the numbers with `+/-` button;

It also has **keyboard support** and is **responsive** for other devices.

I made a modal box with a **guide** on how to use the keyboard. The guide only shows on a desktop and laptop screens.

**[This](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-calculator)** was the last project in the [Foundations Course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations) from **[The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)**. For this reason, I wanted to make it look pretty good, that's why I insisted on some aspects. I have applied everything I have learned up to this point plus some extra concepts.
